# Ethereum-price-prediction-
Ethereum price prediction using machine learning model
This repository contains a Python script for predicting Ethereum prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It leverages historical price data from Yahoo Finance and deep learning techniques for accurate forecasting.
# Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn keras
# Usage:
Adjust start_date and end_date in the script to specify the historical data range.
# Results:
Explore the generated plots showcasing predicted Ethereum prices against the actual prices.
The trained model is saved as pre.h5.
# Customization
Feel free to customize the script for different time periods or model configurations.
Experiment with hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
# Acknowledgments
This project was motivated by the desire to apply LSTM networks for Ethereum price prediction.
